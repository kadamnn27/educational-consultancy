                transparent consultancy fees structure which is based on NEET
                Rank, Fees budget and Category. The counseling fees is defined on
                the basis of time and efforts involved in securing the admission
                for candidate. As you might have observed, if the student's NEET
                Rank is high, our consultancy fees is very less (In fact it is
              free if the candidate has scored >630 marks in NEET) because time
                and efforts involved in securing the admission for that candidate
                will be much less as compared to candidate with lower NEET Rank.

                Expert Educational Consultancy strongly believe that medical
                admission counseling requires intelligence not the information. In
                fact, over last 26 years we have seen many people who suffered
                because they could not convert information into intelligence.
                That's the reason we as policy don't want to misguide or confuse
                students with information. Moreover, Google has made the
                information freely available to all, one can always get
                information from internet. Expert Educational Consultancy however
